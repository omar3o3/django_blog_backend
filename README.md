Welcome to the back end portion of Rambler. This is my first project using Python for the back end of my web applications.

The tech stack for the back end of Rambler includes Django / Django Rest Framework, beautifulsoup4, django-cors-headers, djangorestframework-simplejwt, lxml, and selenium.

For the database I used PostgreSQL.

The purpose of this projec was to create a social media site inspired by famous sites such as Twitter and Reddit.

The tech stack for the front end of Rambler includes react, material ui,
react-router-dom, and jwt-decode.
